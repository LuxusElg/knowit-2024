### Task 03
Much more difficult to visualize in Haskell due to the lack of mutable variables.
Did certainly not help that the task was poorly described and had some off-by-one errors in the example text.
Ended up having to create a proof in javascript just to figure out the rules of the task before finishing the Haskell implementation.
